  	<img src="NewArreguin.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 550px;">
  	<p>Hello! My name is Chano Arreguin, the proud son of Mexican immigrants born and raised in California's Central Valley. I am currently a PhD candidate at Rice University in the department of Political Science. I completed a BA in Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
	<p>My academic interests are understanding the sources and consequences of public opinion and how the masses can make competent decisions. More specifically, I am interested in how affectively charged (or expressive) social/partisan identities interact with more instrumental policy desires in influencing political motivation and behavior. I am also interested in drawing links with the human evolutionary sciences whenever helpful in presenting a more comprehensive explanation of human behavior. </p>

	<li><b>Arreguin</b>, "<u>The Contours of Preferences for Economic Policy Outcomes</u>"</li>
		<p>  It is often an unquestioned assumption that partisans in the United States want different policy outcomes given their varying political preferences and choices. Whether rooted in values, a salient identity, interests, fleeting attitudes, or elite rhetoric, opposing partisan preferences that lead to different political choices are implicitly linked to desires for distinct policy outcomes. An issue with this link is the fact that revealed preferences in political contexts are biased revelations of true preferences given strategic thinking. Additionally, direct connections between outcomes and future preferences are themselves difficult to draw since outcomes are generally noisy preventing a clear linkage. The resulting uncertainty complicates inference of true preferences from constituent retrospective updating given policy outcomes. I conduct a conjoint experiment to gauge the extent to which partisans prefer different outcomes, where revealed preference is directly coupled to policy outcomes. The results illustrate a nuanced picture of partisan preferences.</p>
        <li><b>Arreguin</b>, "<u>The Conditionally Competent Voter: When Instrumental versus Expressive Motivations Influence Decision-Making</u>"</li>
		<p>Voter competence -- the ability of voters to elect politicians into office who can effectively bring about desired or positive outcomes -- is subject to continual debate in political science. One camp argues that voters are largely ignorant of policy outcomes, showcasing when constituents are driven by their identity rooted in emotional attachments to social groups. This contrasts the "rational" view of democratic accountability, which presents evidence that policy issues and other objective outcomes drive voter behavior. I argue that both sources of motivation can coexist, and show how context determines which source ultimately influences decision-making. In contexts where there is greater attribution of policy outcomes that voterâ€™s care about to incumbent actions, this component is weighed more heavily. In contexts where policy outcomes are "noisier," the identity component attains more weight in decision-making. I design a novel randomized control experiment and find evidence for one of these mechanisms.</p>
