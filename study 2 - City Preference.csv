You were selected to participate in this study because you are a United States citizen.
The purpose of this study is to see what attributes matter to people when choosing a city. You will be shown hypothetical profiles of cities and select among them. After you make these selections you will have to respond to some basic demographic questions. The total length of the survey should be no more than 7-10 minutes.  

You may not directly benefit from this research; however, we hope that your participation in the study may help us learn about what matters to people when making lifestyle choices. 

We believe there are no known risks associated with this research study; however, as with any online related activity the risk of a breach of confidentiality is always possible. To the best of our ability your answers in this study will remain confidential. We will minimize any risks by not collecting any personally identifiable information, and storing all responses on the investigators secured computers.
